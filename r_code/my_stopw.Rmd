Create a list of stopwords in excel or notebook and save it in .csv format.
The list I created is called mystopwords.csv.
The add the 

```{r}
#create new stopwords list

stopw <- read.csv("mystopwords.csv", header = FALSE)
stopw <- as.character(stopw$V1)
```

As previously, get a dfm matrix based on the corpus on which we removed stepwords, now adding also our additional stopwords - stopw

```{r}
speech.corpus.dfm <- dfm(speech.corpus, stem=T, remove_numbers = TRUE, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE,  remove = c(stopwords("en"), stopw))
```
